# AGENTS.md — AgentHub (Codex Platform)

> Codex reads this file before every task. It is the session protocol for the `hub` plugin.

---

## Invocation syntax (CRITICAL)

**In Codex, this plugin is invoked with `@hub <command>` — never `/hub:<command>`.**

- ✅ Correct: `@hub brainstorm`, `@hub debug`, `@hub plan`, `@hub help agents`
- ❌ Wrong: `/hub:brainstorm`, `/hub:debug` — the `/` prefix is a Codex built-in and rejects plugin commands

**When writing responses to the user, you MUST always suggest commands as `@hub <name>`.** Never emit `/hub:` in your output, even though the skill files below (shared with Claude Code) use that form internally. Translate `/hub:<x>` → `@hub <x>` whenever you mention a command to the user.

---

## How to invoke this plugin

**Primary:** Type `@hub` in the Codex composer. Codex will show the plugin and its bundled skills via autocomplete.

**Skills picker:** Type `$` in the composer to open the skill picker. Hub skills appear as `$hub-debug`, `$hub-plan`, etc.

**Do NOT use `/hub:*` (slash prefix)** — the `/` prefix is reserved for Codex built-in commands. Plugin commands typed as `/hub:debug` will be rejected as unknown commands by Codex. Always use `@hub debug`, `@hub plan`, etc.

The `name` field in this plugin's manifest is `hub` — that is the `@hub` handle.

## What this plugin is

**AgentHub** — 20 specialist subagents, 42 skills, and 17 workflows for OpenAI Codex.

- `agents/*.toml` — 20 Codex agent definitions
- `commands/*.md` — 17 workflow templates (invoked via `@hub`, never `/hub:`)
- `skills/*/SKILL.md` — 42 shared skills (platform-agnostic, also used by Claude Code)
- `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` — manifest

All paths above are relative to this plugin's root (`plugins/hub/` in the source repo).

---

## Workspace automatic mode

This repository has a root `AGENTS.md` that enables a Master Orchestrator behavior. In this workspace, do not wait for the user to type `@hub` before applying AgentHub expertise.

For every user interaction:

1. Analyze intent, domains, risk, and complexity.
2. Select the smallest useful set of `hub:*` specialists.
3. Use the specialist agents automatically when the runtime exposes them.
4. If the runtime does not expose them directly, read the relevant agent TOML and skill files, then apply that guidance directly.
5. Return one synthesized response or complete the requested implementation.

The local master orchestrator definition is `agents/master-orchestrator.toml`.

## Workflow invocation via @hub

When a user types `@hub` followed by a workflow name, read the matching file from `commands/<name>.md` (relative to this plugin's root) and follow its `## Flow` section. The `$ARGUMENTS` placeholder is replaced with whatever the user typed after the workflow name.

| User types | Read this file | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `@hub debug <symptom>` | `commands/debug.md` | Systematic root-cause investigation |
| `@hub plan <feature>` | `commands/plan.md` | Generate docs/PLAN-*.md, no code |
| `@hub create <app>` | `commands/create.md` | Scaffold a new application |
| `@hub enhance <change>` | `commands/enhance.md` | Add/update features |
| `@hub test [generate\|run]` | `commands/test.md` | Write or run tests |
| `@hub deploy [staging\|prod]` | `commands/deploy.md` | Pre-flight + deploy |
| `@hub brainstorm <idea>` | `commands/brainstorm.md` | Explore options, no code |
| `@hub orchestrate <task>` | `commands/orchestrate.md` | ≥3 agents, 2-phase pipeline |
| `@hub status` | `commands/status.md` | Project state snapshot |
| `@hub help [agents\|skills\|<name>]` | `commands/help.md` | Capability index |

## Agent routing

When a request matches a domain, route to the appropriate agent:

| Domain | Agent |
|---|---|
| Bug / error / crash | `hub:debugger` |
| New application | `hub:project-planner` → `hub:backend-specialist` + `hub:frontend-specialist` |
| Feature addition | `hub:backend-specialist` or `hub:frontend-specialist` (stack-aware) |
| Database / schema | `hub:database-architect` |
| Security audit | `hub:security-auditor` |
| Offensive security / CTF | `hub:penetration-tester` |
| Performance | `hub:performance-optimizer` |
| Deployment / CI/CD | `hub:devops-engineer` |
| Tests / TDD | `hub:test-engineer` |
| E2E / Playwright | `hub:qa-automation-engineer` |
| UI / React / components | `hub:frontend-specialist` |
| Mobile / React Native | `hub:mobile-developer` |
| SEO / Core Web Vitals | `hub:seo-specialist` |
| Game development | `hub:game-developer` |
| Codebase exploration | `hub:explorer-agent` |
| Documentation only | `hub:documentation-writer` |
| Planning only | `hub:project-planner` |
| Brainstorm / options | `hub:product-manager` |
| Multi-domain / complex | `hub:orchestrator` (≥3 agents, 2-phase) |
| Legacy / reverse-engineering | `hub:code-archaeologist` |

## Approval-first dispatch

Every workflow declares a tier. Workflows never silently fan out agents.

- **LIGHT** — runs directly (`@hub status`, `@hub help`, `@hub preview`)
- **MEDIUM** — one-line confirm before dispatching (`@hub debug`, `@hub plan`, `@hub test generate`)
- **HEAVY** — full gate: planned agents, skills, ~token estimate, MoSCoW, ≥2 alternatives (`@hub create`, `@hub enhance`, `@hub deploy`, `@hub orchestrate`)

Pass `--yes` or `-y` after the workflow name to bypass any gate. Usage logs to `.hub/usage.json` in the user's project.

---

## Skill loading

Skills in `skills/*/SKILL.md` are platform-agnostic. Each agent TOML lists its skills in `[skills] config` and its `[instructions]` block includes explicit read directives. Skills surface to users via the `$` picker as `$hub-<skill-name>`.

---

## Rule priority

P0 (this file) > P1 (agent TOML `[instructions]`) > P2 (skill `SKILL.md`)

---

## Honesty contract

Token estimates are always prefixed `~`. Never convert to dollars. Never fabricate quota or reset-timestamp numbers.
