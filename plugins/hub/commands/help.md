# @hub help — Capability Index

$ARGUMENTS

## Flow

Read `CATALOG.md` from the repo root (one Read call — no bash, no glob).
Path: `../../CATALOG.md` relative to this file, or `CATALOG.md` from the repo root.

Render per argument:
- *empty* → OVERVIEW: workflow + tier-bucketed commands + agent roster
- `commands` → full command table from CATALOG.md
- `agents` → all 20 agents grouped by domain from CATALOG.md
- `skills` → all 42 skills grouped by cluster from CATALOG.md
- `<name>` → LOOKUP: try in order: `commands/<name>.md`, `agents/<name>.toml`, `../../skills/<name>/SKILL.md`

No agent dispatch. No writes. One Read call for overview; two for lookup.

## Examples
```
@hub help
@hub help commands
@hub help agents
@hub help debugger
@hub help approval-gate
```
